Introduction to TensorFlow.

## Part 2: Music Generation with RNNs
![](Music_Generation.png)
Building a Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) for Music Generation. We will be using a "Character RNN" to predict the next character of sheet music in "ABC notation". We will test the model by creating brand new music.
