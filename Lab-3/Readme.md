## Part 1: Cart-Pole Problem
Solving Cart-Pole Problem using Reinforcement Learning with OpenAI Gym. The Environment in Cart-Pole Problem is a Static one and no opposing player is present. The video of the end result of implementation after trying a lot of options is available by the name "Cart-Pole.mp4". Performance of Model is good after it is trained for 500 Iterations.

## Part 2: Pong
Implementing Reinforcement Learning Algorithm on Pong with OpenAI Gym. The Environment in Pong is Dynamic in nature and it also consists of an opposing player.The video of the end result of implementation is available by the name "Pong.mp4". The Model is trained for 100 Iterations. As Pong is a complex game to model more iterations are reqired to train the model and achieve good results.
